Youtube2zim
=============

`youtube2zim` allows you to create a [ZIM file](https://openzim.org) from a Youtube Channel/username or one-or-more Playlists.

It downloads the video (webm or mp4 format â€“ optionnaly recompress them in lower-quality, smaller size), the thumbnails, the subtitles and the authors' profile pictures ; then, it create a static HTML files folder of it before creating a ZIM off of it.

# Requirements

* [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) for video transcoding (only used with `--lower-quality`).
* [`zimwriterfs`](https://github.com/openzim/zimwriterfs) for ZIM file packaging. Use `--no-zim` to skip this step.
* `curl` and `unzip` to install JS dependencies. See `get_js_deps.sh` if you want to do it manually.

# Installation

`youtube2zim` is a python program. if you are not using the docker image, you are advised to use it in a virtualenv. See `requirements.txt` for the list of python dependencies.

## docker

```
docker run -v my_dir:/output openzim/youtube2zim youtube2zim --help
```

## pip

```
pip install youtube2zim
youtube2zim --help
```

## source

```
python youtube2zim --help
```

# Usage

`youtube2zim` uses Youtube API v3 to fetch data from Youtube. You thus need to provide an `API_KEY` to use the scraper.

To get an API:

1. Connect to [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)
2. Create a new _Project_ then Select it.
3. When asked, choose _Create Credentials_ and select the **API Key** type. ([Credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials))

```
youtube2zim --api-key "<your-api-key>" --type user --id "Vsauce"
```

# Developers note

In order to support all platform, we default to `webm` video format. `mp4` one (h264), is not available in Webview on most platform due to patent restrictions.

On the other hand, `webm` is not supported in Safari (macOS, iOS).

We thus use `ogv.js`, to play webm videos on browsers that don't support it. Using `video.js`, we default to native playback if supported.

`ogv.js` is an emscripten-based JS decoder for webm and thus dynamically loads differents parts at run-time on platforms that needs them. It has two consequences:

* `file://` scheme doesn't work as the binary `.wasm` files are sent naively as `text/html` instead of `application/oct-stream`. If you want to use the HTML generated folder instead of ZIM, serve it through a web server and [configure the Content-Type response](https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/WebAssembly.html#web-server-setup).
* [ZIM](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_file_format) places JS files under the `/-/` namespace and binary ones under the `/I/` one. Dynamically loading of JS and WASM files within `ogv.js` requires us to tweak it to introduce some ZIM-specific logic. See `fix_ogvjs_dist.py`.

Because the pagination system is implemented in JS, we also need to generate links there. For that to work both in static HTML and in-ZIM, we detect it using a `<link id="favicon">` in HTML files. This link needs to be present and parsed before loading the help `zim_prefix.js` script.
